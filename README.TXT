PROJECT TITLE: Linked List Queue 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The program uses a Queue to represent the customer objects waiting in line. The program simulates 60 minutes of activity at the store. Each iteration of the program represents one minute. At each iteration, the program checks to see if new customers are dded to the queue. There is a 25% chance that new customer will show up and needs to be added to the queue. Also, at each iteration, the program updates the customer object currently being serviced. This will be the customer object at the front of the queue. If the customer has been completely serviced, they are removed from the queue. After execution, when a new customer is added to the queue, there is an output that prints "New customer added! Queue length is now X, where X is the size of the queue after the new customer has been added. Also after a customer has been completley serviced, there is an output saying 'Customer serviced and removed from the queue. Queue length is now X. At the end of each iteration there is an output of '-----------------------------' to idenfity the passing of time
